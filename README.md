Fashion MNIST CNN Classifier
This repository contains a Python script for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras.

Description
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of fashion items such as shirts, trousers, and shoes. This script implements a CNN model using Keras, a high-level neural networks API, to classify these images into their respective categories.

Key Features
Data Loading: Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset for training and testing.
Model Definition: Defines a CNN architecture with convolutional, max-pooling, fully connected, and dropout layers.
Model Training: Compiles and trains the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance on the test data.
Prediction: Makes predictions on a sample of test images and compares predicted labels with actual labels.
Dependencies
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
Usage
Ensure TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy are installed.
Run the script (fashion_mnist_cnn.py) in a Python environment or on platforms like Google Colab.
